Patient Registration Form using UiPath in RPA
🚀 Project Overview
This project, Patient Registration Form, is developed using UiPath to automate the process of registering patients efficiently and accurately in healthcare systems. By leveraging Robotic Process Automation (RPA), the solution eliminates manual errors and accelerates the registration process.

🎯 Objectives
Automate patient registration in healthcare systems.
Enhance data accuracy and reduce human error.
Improve the efficiency of patient onboarding workflows.
🛠️ Features
Data Extraction: Automates the retrieval of patient information from input forms or systems.
Error Handling: Validates the input data to ensure accuracy.
Notifications: Sends confirmation emails upon successful registration.
🔧 Tools & Technologies
UiPath Studio: For designing and implementing automation workflows.
Languages: [If applicable, e.g., VB.NET, Python].
Additional Tools: [e.g., Excel, APIs, OCR for form processing].
